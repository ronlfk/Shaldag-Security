    <p>Privacy Policy for Shaldag Security Mobile Games</p>
</header>

<main>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Shaldag Security</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”)
        handles information in connection with our mobile games and related services
        (collectively, the “Services”). We are committed to protecting the privacy of our
        players and being transparent about our data practices.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Scope of this Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This Policy applies to all mobile games and applications published by Shaldag Security
        on app stores such as Google Play and any other platforms where our games are made available.
        By installing, accessing, or using our games, you agree to the terms described in this Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Information We Do Not Collect Directly</h2>
    <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> require you to create an account, provide your real name, email address,
        phone number, or any other contact details in order to play our games.
    </p>
    <p>
        As of the date of this Policy, Shaldag Security does not intentionally collect, store,
        or process personal information directly from users through in-game forms, registrations,
        or similar mechanisms.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Information That May Be Collected Automatically</h2>
    <p>
        Our games may use standard technologies provided by the platform (for example,
        Google Play) and/or third-party services (such as analytics or advertising providers).
        These services may automatically collect certain technical information when you use
        the game, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information (device model, operating system version, language settings)</li>
        <li>App version, crash logs, and basic diagnostics</li>
        <li>Anonymous usage data (game sessions, generic interactions, in-game events)</li>
        <li>Advertising identifiers or similar identifiers provided by the platform</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This information is generally used for purposes such as ensuring the game works properly,
        improving performance and stability, and, where applicable, delivering and measuring
        advertising.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Depending on the specific game, we may integrate third-party services such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>App store services (e.g., Google Play)</li>
        <li>Analytics tools (for understanding crashes and performance)</li>
        <li>Advertising networks (for displaying ads inside the game)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These third parties may process data in accordance with their own privacy policies and
        terms. We do not control how they handle data and encourage you to review their policies
        for more details. Where required by applicable law or platform rules, any tracking or
        personalized advertising features are subject to your consent and device settings.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our games are designed for a general audience and are not specifically directed at
        children under the age required by local law to provide consent to data processing on
        their own. If we become aware that we have unintentionally received personal information
        from a child in a manner that requires parental consent, we will take steps to remove
        such information as soon as reasonably possible.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to help protect the information
        processed in connection with our games against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
        alteration, or unauthorized access. However, no method of transmission or storage is
        completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        To the extent any information is processed by third-party services on our behalf,
        such information is generally retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill the
        purposes described in this Policy or as required by applicable law or platform rules.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights and Controls</h2>
    <p>
        Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data,
        such as the right to access, correct, or delete information, or to object to or restrict
        certain types of processing. Because we do not collect personal data directly within the
        game, many of these rights may need to be exercised directly through the platform
        (for example, your device settings or app store account) or with the relevant third-party
        provider (such as an analytics or advertising network).
    </p>

    <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>
        Our games may be available globally. Data processed by third-party services may be
        transferred to and stored in countries other than your country of residence. These
        countries may have different data protection laws. Where required, such transfers are
        carried out in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example to reflect changes
        in our games, in applicable laws, or in the services we use. When we make material
        changes, we will update the “Last Updated” date below. Your continued use of our games
        after such changes become effective will constitute your acceptance of the revised Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>

        may be handled in connection with our games, you can contact us at:
