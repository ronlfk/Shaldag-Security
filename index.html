    <p>Privacy Policy for Mobile Games and Applications</p>
</header>

<main>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Shaldag Security</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”)
handles information in connection with all mobile games and applications published by us
(the “Apps”). We are committed to protecting user privacy and being transparent about our data practices.
</p>

<h2>2. Scope of This Policy</h2>
<p>
This Policy applies to all games and applications developed or published by Shaldag Security
and made available on platforms such as Google Play, the Apple App Store, and other distribution platforms.
By downloading or using our Apps, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
We do not require users to create accounts or provide personal information such as names,
email addresses, phone numbers, or payment details.
</p>
<p>
However, our Apps may collect <strong>limited non-personal and device-related information</strong>
automatically through third-party SDKs integrated into the Apps.
</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party SDKs and Advertising</h2>
<p>
Our Apps use third-party services to support monetization, performance, and functionality.
These services may automatically collect certain information as described below.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> – used to display advertisements within our Apps.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Google AdMob may collect information such as:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Advertising identifiers (such as Google Advertising ID)</li>
    <li>IP address (may be used to estimate general location)</li>
    <li>Device information (model, operating system, language)</li>
    <li>Ad interaction data (views, clicks, impressions)</li>
</ul>

<p>
This information is collected and processed by Google in accordance with
Google’s own Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
We do not have direct access to or control over the data collected by third-party SDKs.
</p>

<h2>5. How Information Is Used</h2>
<p>
Information collected via third-party SDKs may be used for the following purposes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Displaying ads and measuring ad performance</li>
    <li>Preventing fraud and abuse</li>
    <li>Improving app stability and user experience</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
Our Apps are intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect personal
information from children under the age of 13 (or under the applicable age of consent
in the user’s jurisdiction).
</p>
<p>
Advertising shown to users may be configured to comply with applicable child protection
laws (including COPPA), where required.
</p>

<h2>7. Data Security</h2>
<p>
We do not store personal data on our own servers.
Any data collected by third-party SDKs is protected by the security measures implemented
by those providers.
</p>

<h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
<p>
We do not retain personal data ourselves.
Data retention practices of third-party services are governed by their own policies.
</p>

<h2>9. User Choices</h2>
<p>
Users may control ad personalization through their device settings, including resetting
or limiting the use of advertising identifiers where supported by the operating system.
</p>

<h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>
Third-party services used in our Apps may process data on servers located outside your country.
Such transfers are handled in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
</p>

<h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page
with an updated “Last Updated” date.
