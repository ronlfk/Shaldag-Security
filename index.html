    <p>Privacy Policy for Shaldag Security Mobile Games</p>
</header>

<main>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Shaldag Security</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”)
        handles information in connection with our mobile games and related services
        (collectively, the “Services”). We are committed to protecting the privacy of our
        players and being transparent about our data practices.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Scope of this Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This Policy applies to all mobile games and applications published by Shaldag Security
        on app stores such as Google Play and any other platforms where our games are made available.
        By installing, accessing, or using our games, you agree to the terms described in this Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Information We Do Not Collect Directly</h2>
    <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> require you to create an account, provide your real name, email address,
        phone number, or any other contact details in order to play our games.
    </p>
    <p>
        As of the date of this Policy, Shaldag Security does not intentionally collect, store,
        or process personal information directly from users through in-game forms, registrations,
        or similar mechanisms.
    </p>

    <!-- UPDATED SECTION 4 -->
    <h2>4. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Shaldag Security does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, track, or process any personal
        or non-personal data from users. Our games do not request access to your device
        information, location, identifiers, analytics data, or any form of usage statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not collect or record gameplay behavior, device model, operating system,
        crash logs, advertising identifiers, or any technical or diagnostic information.
    </p>

    <!-- UPDATED SECTION 5 -->
    <h2>5. No Third-Party SDKs or Data Services</h2>
    <p>
        Our games do <strong>not</strong> integrate any third-party SDKs, analytics systems,
        advertising networks, tracking tools, or external plugins that collect or process data.
    </p>
    <p>
        All games operate entirely offline and locally on your device, without transmitting
        any information to us or to any third-party service.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our games are designed for a general audience and are not specifically directed at
        children under the age required by local law to provide consent to data processing on
        their own. If we become aware that we have unintentionally received personal information
        from a child, we will take steps to remove such information as soon as reasonably possible.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to help protect the information
        processed in connection with our games. However, since we do not collect data, no information
        is stored on our systems.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        Because we do not collect or process any user information, no data is retained by us.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights and Controls</h2>
    <p>
        Since no data is collected, there is no personal information to access, correct, or delete.
        Users maintain full privacy and control as no data is ever transmitted or stored.
    </p>

    <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>
        Our games do not transmit any information outside of your device. No international
        transfers take place.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our games or legal requirements.
        When we make updates, the “Last Updated” date will be modified accordingly.
    </p>
